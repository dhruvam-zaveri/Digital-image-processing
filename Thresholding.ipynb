    "# Image Thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "Image thresholding is a simple, yet effective, way of partitioning an image into a foreground and background. This image analysis technique is a type of image segmentation that isolates objects by converting grayscale images into binary images. Image thresholding is most effective in images with high levels of contrast.\n",

    "Types of thresholding:\n",
    "1. Simple thresholding\n",

But consider a bimodal image (In simple words, bimodal image is an image whose histogram has two peaks). For that image, we can approximately take a value in the middle of those peaks as threshold value, right ? That is what Otsu binarization does. So in simple words, it automatically calculates a threshold value from image histogram for a bimodal image. (For images which are not bimodal, binarization won’t be accurate).\n",
